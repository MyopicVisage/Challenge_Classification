# Classification_Challenge

Thank you for taking the time to walk through my code. This work is the copyright of the author, William Schram, and is intended solely for the purposes of displaying machine learning and python development skills. It is my intention with is file to convey that I can clean a data set, generate new features, apply a machine learning model, tune hyper-parameters, plot graphs, and generate exports.

This is not a representation of my present work, nor is the code derived therefrom. I presently specialize in superior machine learning techniques (stacking & ensemble techniques, neural networks, big data parallelization, and GPU computation), but I offer this example as a means of conveying mastery of data science skills.  

If you would like to make suggestions to the code or suggest upgrades please contact me at myopicvisage@gmail.com. I do not intend to provide the data set for this example, please do not ask me for it.
